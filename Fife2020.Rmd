*Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* is a microscopic plant-feeding eriophyid mite. Eriophyoid mites are very host specific [@Skoracka2009; @Oldfield1996c]  and *P. fructiphilus* only feeds on plants in the genus *Rosa* [@Amrine1996]. *P. fructiphilus* is the vector of Rose Rosette Virus (RRV). RRV infection is commonly associated with the following symptoms: witches’ brooms/rosetting, deformed flowers, increased prickle density, elongated shoots, reddened leaves and stems, and increased die-back
which ultimately kills the rose host [@Amrine1996]. This disease is known as Rose Rosette Disease (RRD). and is the most serious disease of roses, creating millions of dollars of losses for growers. Rose Rosette Disease and the mite have invaded the southeastern united states as they followed the range expansion of the non-native *Rosa multiflora* (Thunb) towards the coast [@Amrine2002; @Otero-Colina2018].

RRD has been detected in Florida in 2014 on 15 plants; however, the plants were destroyed and *P. fructiphilus* were not detected on the roses at that time [@Babu2014].

In 2018 we began a series of surveys along the borders of northern Florida and southern Georgia.
Survey efforts initially focused on cities with populations over 1,000, including Leon, Gadsden and other counties in the surrounding regions. Rose tissue samples were taken from the periphery of various roses: samples included a mixture of flowers, fruits, buds and short lengths of rose cane, trimmed with bypass pruners and stored in quart sized plastic baggies. Pruners were sanitized with 70% ethanol between cuts. Rose species and coordinates were recorded to map out sites which had predatory mites, *P. fructiphilus*, or possibly RRD.

Samples were processed using a washing method derived from @Monfreda2007: cut roses were soaked in a 500 mL beaker with a solution of 1:1 bleach:water with few drops of dishwasher detergent. The solution was stirred vigorously with a glass rod to dislodge any mites. This solution was then poured over a stack of sieves with decreasing screen sizes: 180 &mu;m, 53 &mu;m and 25 &mu;m.
The beaker and rose pieces were further rinsed with tap water over the sieve stack to knock off any remaining mites. The 25 &mu;m sieve screen traps mites which are the size of *P. fructiphilus*. This sieve was then backwashed from the underside of the screen with a water-filled wash bottle, starting from the highest point of the sieve and working to the bottom of the sieve to flush the trapped debris into a 50 ml centrifuge tube for storage and future observation. Samples were observed under a dissecting microscope. Mites found among the plant debris were siphoned off with a glass pipette and subsequently stored in micro-centrifuge containers filled with 95% ethanol as a preservative. Select specimens were mounted directly into Hoyer's slide mountant (Hempstead Halide, Inc. Galveston, TX), dried at 90&deg;C, then ringed with nail polish. 

On February 14, 2019, we found a total of 42 eriophyid mites from six samples obtained while surveying roses in Leon County, Florida. (see *`r citef("sidemaps")`A*) The mites were sent to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services - Department of Plant Industry (FDACS-DPI) and were all identified as *P. fructiphilus* using the keys provided in [@key_used]. The roses did not show signs or symptoms of RDD. These roses were tested for RRV with RT-qPCR and Reverse Transcription Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RT-RPA) [@Babu2016; @Babu2017a]. However, none of the plants infested with *P. fructiphilus* were positive for RRV.

On July 16th we conducted an additional survey of 33 roses near the initial site of discovery, including the rose sites where P. fructiphilus were originally detected. (see *`r citef("sidemaps")`B*), Each sample contained more than 50 eriophyid mites, with some samples containing over 300 mites. We compared the samples collected during February and July with a paired t-test and we found a significant increase in *P. fructiphilus* population between the two sampling dates: p-value = 0.001, α = 0.05, df = 4. A subsample of these mites were slide mounted and subsequently confirmed as *P. fructiphilus*. Additional rose samples were tested for RRV by RT-qPCR, but no virus was detected.

This is the first record for *P. fructiphilus* in Florida. More importantly, RRV is currently not established in Florida. None of the mite-infested roses had symptoms of RRD and none were positive for RRV. However, the presence of *P. fructiphilus*, along with past detections of RRV in Florida warrants increased monitoring for the mite and virus in Florida. There is a critical need to develop methods to manage *P. fructiphilus* and RRV, or the US rose industry stands to lose millions on mite control.

Summary

The invasive mite *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* (Acari: Trombidiformes, Eriophyidae) feeds on plants in the genus *Rosa* and is known as the primary vector of Rose Rosette Virus, the causal agent of Rose Rosette Disease (RRD) (Bunyavirales: Emaraviridae). The mite *P. fructiphilus* is reported for the first time in Florida, USA. No roses showed signs or symptoms of viral infection, and no virus was detected using molecular methods. *P. fructiphilus* represents a potential threat to the Florida rose industry if RRD becomes established.

Resumen  

El ácaro invasivo *Phyllocoptes fructiphilius* (Acari: Trombidiformes, Eriophyidae) se alimenta en plantas del género *Rosa* y es conocido principalmente como vector de la Virus Rosetón Rosal, el agente causal de la Enfermedad Rosetón Rosal (ERR) (Bunyavirales: Emaraviridae). El ácaro *P. fructiphilus* se reporta por la primera vez en Florida, USA. Ninguna rosa se mostró señales ni síntomas de infección viral, y ninguno virus fue detectado con métodos moleculares. *P. fructiphilus* se representa una amenaza potencial para la industria rosal Florideña si la ERR se establezca en Florida.
